This repository consists of a simple script to compute T scores (weight adjusted erg scores) when provided with a list of names, weights, and either erg splits or watts. 

T scores are a performance metric used by lightweight rowers to adjust erg (rowing machine) performance based on rower weight. 

The script can take in weights in either pounds or kilograms, but not both. It can also read data as both erg splits (such as 1:59.3) or watts.
